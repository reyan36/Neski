The 3-Step Checklist for Later:
Hide the AI Key: Delete the Google Key from your HTML and put it inside a secure Vercel API Route (Method 1).
Lock the Database: Go to Supabase and enable RLS Policies so users can only edit/delete their own posts (right now, anyone could technically delete anything).
Clean GitHub: Make sure you never upload the file with the hardcoded keys to a public GitHub repository.
